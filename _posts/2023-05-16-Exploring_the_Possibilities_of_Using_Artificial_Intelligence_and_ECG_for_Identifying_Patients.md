On **16 May 2023**, I had the pleasure of presenting my work *“Exploring the Possibilities of Using Artificial Intelligence and ECG for Identifying Patients”* at the event **AI in the Medical Field**, organized by the **House of AI** at **Badji Mokhtar – Annaba University**.  
The event, held on the occasion of **Students’ Day**, gathered professors, researchers, PhD candidates, and students from diverse disciplines to explore the transformative role of AI in healthcare.  
Adding to the occasion, **Radio Annaba** covered the event, helping share the discussions with a wider audience.

## Why ECG for Identification?

Biometric technologies—fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans—are already part of our daily lives. However, **electrocardiogram (ECG)-based biometrics** offer a distinctive advantage: they originate from internal physiological signals unique to each individual and can be integrated directly into existing medical monitoring systems.  
This opens up intriguing possibilities for patient identification in clinical environments, potentially improving both security and efficiency.

## Engaging Discussions

Following the talk, I enjoyed **fruitful discussions** with attendees from different departments of Annaba University.  
We explored:  
- How ECG biometrics could be integrated into hospital systems.  
- Ethical and privacy concerns around storing physiological data.  
- The technical hurdles in acquiring clean ECG signals in real-world conditions.

## Reflections

Speaking to such a diverse audience reinforced my belief that advances in healthcare AI will depend on strong collaboration between engineers, data scientists, and medical professionals. The questions and insights I received have already helped me refine the focus of my future research.
