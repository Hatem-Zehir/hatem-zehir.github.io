On **18 May 2025**, I presented *“How to Use AI to Summarize Books Effectively: Tools & Prompts for the AI Masters Challenge”* at **Badji Mokhtar – Annaba University**. The event was organized by the **House of AI** on the occasion of **Students’ Day** and brought together enthusiastic students participating in the **AI Masters Challenge**, a friendly competition between student teams to determine who can best leverage AI tools for bibliographical research.

## About the AI Masters Challenge

The challenge encouraged students to explore innovative uses of artificial intelligence in academic work.  
Each team was tasked with finding, analyzing, and summarizing book content efficiently, testing not just their knowledge of AI tools, but also their creativity and strategic thinking.

## Presentation Highlights

**1. Tools Offered by the Central Library of UBMA**  
I started by introducing the digital resources available through the **Central Library**. These include academic databases, online catalogs, and ebook platforms that students can combine with AI for faster, more accurate summarization.

**2. AI Tools You Can Use**  
We explored a variety of AI-powered applications capable of summarizing long texts, extracting key points, and even generating thematic outlines.  
I demonstrated how these tools can:  
- Process large volumes of information in minutes.  
- Provide structured summaries for complex books.  
- Offer multilingual support for non-English resources.

**3. Smart Prompts to Guide Your Search**  
Finally, I explained the importance of **prompt engineering** — the art of asking AI the right questions to get the most relevant and accurate results.  
We covered:  
- Structuring prompts to focus on specific chapters or topics.  
- Combining context with instructions for better output quality.  
- Avoiding vague queries that lead to generic results.

## Engaging the Audience

Because the audience consisted of participants in an active competition, the session was highly interactive.  
Students tested the techniques in real time, experimenting with prompts and tools to see immediate improvements in their search and summarization results.

## Reflections

The energy in the room was contagious — it was inspiring to see students approach AI not just as a set of tools, but as a way of thinking critically about information gathering.  
The AI Masters Challenge demonstrated that with the right resources and strategies, AI can dramatically accelerate academic research while maintaining accuracy and depth.
