**Credits:** 6 | **Coefficient:** 3 | **Course Unit:** UEM 1.1
**Mode of Instruction:** In-person  

This course equips students in automation with the ability to master a modern, powerful, and versatile programming language suitable for developing software in embedded systems, robotics, and electronics. Such skills enable the design of more efficient and high-performance systems. Students will learn fundamental programming concepts including variables, data structures, control structures, input/output operations, and modern programming paradigms.  

**Recommended prerequisites:**  
- Computer architecture  
- Number systems and numerical encoding
