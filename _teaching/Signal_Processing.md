**Credits:** 4 | **Coefficient:** 2 | **Course Unit:** UEF 2.2.2 
**Hourly volume:** 45 h (Lecture: 1h30 | Tutorials: 1h30)  

This course provides students with the mathematical foundations for describing signals, highlighting their key characteristics such as frequency distribution and energy, and analyzing how they are modified during transmission or processing.  

**Recommended prerequisites:**  
- Analysis  
- Algebra  

### Course Content  

**1. Fundamentals of Signals**  
- Definition of a signal and information transmission  
- Classification of signals (morphological, spectral, etc.)  
- Vector representation of signals  
- Power and energy concepts  
- Examples of basic signals: rectangular pulse, triangular pulse, ramp, unit step, sign function, Dirac delta, etc.  

**2. Analysis of Continuous-Time Deterministic Signals**  
- Periodic signals: Fourier series decomposition and spectrum  
- Aperiodic finite-energy signals: continuous-time Fourier transform and properties (linearity, scaling, time shift theorem, time-frequency duality, modulation theorem, integration/differentiation in time), energy spectral density, Parseval’s identity  
- Fourier transform of infinite-energy signals  

**3. Laplace Transform**  
- Definition and common examples (Dirac, unit step, etc.)  
- Properties of the Laplace transform  
- Inverse Laplace transform  
- Convolution product formulation and properties  
- Applications to linear time-invariant (LTI) systems: time and frequency analysis, main properties  

**4. Sampling**  
- Ideal sampling: definition  
- Shannon–Nyquist sampling theorem  
- Spectrum overlap (aliasing)  
- Reconstruction of sampled signals  

**5. Discrete-Time Deterministic Signals**  
- Definitions and examples of discrete signals  
- Properties: periodicity, energy, average power  
- Autocorrelation of discrete signals (finite-energy, finite-average-power, periodic)  
- Cross-correlation between two discrete signals  
- Convolution product  

**6. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)**  
- Definition and properties: direct and inverse DFT, linearity, discrete signal translation, symmetry, circular convolution, Parseval’s equality  
- Comparison between the Fourier transform and the DFT  
- Analysis methods: windowing, zero-padding  

**Assessment:**  
- Written quizzes  
- Supervised assignments  
- Final exam  

By the end of the course, students will be able to mathematically describe, classify, and analyze signals in both continuous and discrete time, and apply Fourier, Laplace, and sampling concepts to signal processing tasks.
