**Credits:** 4 | **Coefficient:** 2 | **Course Unit:** UEF 1
**Hourly volume:** 45 h (Lecture: 1h30 | Lab/TD: 1h30)  

This course introduces the main components of an artificial vision system and the role each plays in its design. It also explores the tools and methods for automatically reproducing tasks performed by the human visual system and interpreted by the brain.  

**Recommended prerequisites:**  
- Signal processing  
- Image processing  

### Course Content  

**1. Image Acquisition and Digitization (2 weeks)**  
- Functional composition of an artificial vision system  
- Image definition  
- Image sensors  
- Image digitization  
- Human vision  
- 3D modeling and camera calibration  

**2. Image Processing Fundamentals (2 weeks)**  
- Point operations: logarithmic transformation, contrast inversion, histogram modification  
- Local operations: spatial filtering, frequency filtering  

**3. Contours and Segmentation (3 weeks)**  
- Contour detection: definition, gradient-based approach, Laplacian approach, Canny filter, LOG filter, active contours  
- Segmentation: histogram thresholding, region-based approaches  

**4. Motion (2 weeks)**  
- Motion estimation  
- Optical flow  
- Horn & Schunk method  
- Block matching  
- Gunnar Farneb√§ck approach  

**5. Feature Detection (2 weeks)**  
- Definition of interest points  
- Geometric transformations  
- Moravec detector  
- Harris detector  
- SIFT  

**6. Machine Learning (3 weeks)**  
- Definition of machine learning  
- Supervised classification: k-NN, Naive Bayes, SVM  
- Unsupervised classification: k-means, Fuzzy c-means  

**Assessment:**  
- Continuous assessment: 40%  
- Final exam: 60%  

By the end of the course, students will be able to design and implement core components of artificial vision systems, apply image acquisition and processing techniques, detect and analyze features, track motion, and leverage machine learning for vision tasks.
