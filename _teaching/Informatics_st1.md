**Credits:** 4 | **Coefficient:** 2 | **Course Unit:** UEM 1.1 
**Hourly volume:** 45 h (Lecture: 1h30 | Lab: 1h30)  

This course enables students to learn programming using a high-level language (Fortran, Pascal, or C), with the choice of language determined by the institution. Algorithmic concepts are addressed implicitly during the learning process.  

**Recommended prerequisites:**  
- Basic knowledge of web technology  

### Course Content  

**Part 1 – Introduction to Computer Science (5 weeks)**  
1. Definition of computer science  
2. Evolution of computing and computers  
3. Information coding systems  
4. Basic principles of computer operation  
5. Computer hardware components  
6. System components:  
   - Operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.)  
   - Programming languages  
   - Application software  

**Part 2 – Algorithms and Programming (10 weeks)**  
1. Concept of an algorithm  
2. Flowchart representation  
3. Structure of a program  
4. Problem analysis and approach  
5. Data structures: constants, variables, and data types  
6. Operators: assignment, relational, logical, arithmetic, operator precedence  
7. Input/output operations  
8. Control structures: conditional and iterative structures  

### Practical Work (TP)  
The lab sessions aim to illustrate the concepts taught in the lectures, and they follow the same progression:  
- Introduction and familiarization with computer hardware and operating systems (exploring OS features)  
- Introduction to programming environments (editing, assembling, compiling, etc.)  
- Application of programming techniques covered in lectures  

**Assessment:**  
- Continuous assessment: 40%  
- Final exam: 60%  

By the end of the course, students will be able to write basic programs in a high-level language, understand fundamental algorithmic concepts, and work confidently with development environments and operating systems.
