**Credits:** 4 | **Coefficient:** 2 | **Course Unit:** UEM 1.1 
**Hourly volume:** 45 h (Lecture: 1h30 | Lab: 1h30)  

This course aims to help students master basic programming and algorithmic techniques, while acquiring fundamental concepts of computer science. The targeted competencies include:  
- Programming with a certain degree of autonomy  
- Designing algorithms ranging from simple to moderately complex  

**Recommended prerequisites:**  
- Ability to use the university website  
- Familiarity with file systems and the Windows user interface  
- Knowledge of a programming environment  

### Course Content  

**1. Indexed Variables (4 weeks)**  
- One-dimensional arrays: memory representation, operations on arrays  
- Two-dimensional arrays: memory representation, operations on two-dimensional arrays  

**2. Functions and Procedures (6 weeks)**  
- Functions: types of functions, function declaration, calling functions  
- Procedures: global vs. local variables, simple procedures, procedures with arguments  

**3. Records and Files (5 weeks)**  
- Heterogeneous data structures  
- Record structure (fields)  
- Manipulating record structures  
- File concepts  
- File access modes  
- Reading from and writing to files  

### Practical Work (TP)  
Practical sessions are designed to implement the programming techniques covered in lectures:  
- Application of programming techniques learned in class  

**Assessment:**  
- Continuous assessment: 40%  
- Final exam: 60%  

By the end of the course, students will be able to work with structured data, create modular programs using functions and procedures, and manage persistent data through file handling.
