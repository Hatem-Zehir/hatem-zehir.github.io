# üëã About Me
Hello, and welcome. My name is Hatem ŸãŸãZehir, and I hold a PhD in Electronics with a specialization in security and biometrics. My academic journey has been shaped by a deep curiosity about how technology can reliably recognize and protect individuals. From the very beginning of my studies, I was fascinated by the idea that something as unique as a heartbeat could serve as a secure key to identity.

During my doctoral research, I developed a hybrid multimodal biometric system that combines electrocardiogram (ECG) signals with voice data. This fusion of physiological and behavioral traits allowed me to explore novel methods of authentication that are more accurate, robust, and resilient to spoofing than traditional unimodal approaches.


Alongside biometrics, I maintain a strong interest in signal processing, image processing, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. What motivates me is the challenge of transforming complex data into meaningful patterns, and designing systems that remain reliable under diverse and unpredictable conditions. For me, research is not only about solving technical problems but also about contributing to a safer, more trustworthy interaction between humans and technology.

# üî¨ Research Interests:
- Biometric Identification: Leveraging ECG, voice, and online handwritten signatures for secure and accurate authentication.
- Deep Learning Architectures: Exploring CNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs for complex signal processing tasks.
- TinyML and Edge Computing: Building and optimizing AI models for resource-constrained environments like the ESP32 and the STM32 microcontrollers.
- Signal Processing: Advanced techniques such as EMD, Hilbert-Huang Transform, and spectrogram analysis for feature extraction.

# üñãÔ∏è Publications:
I have authored several peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers on topics including ECG-based biometric systems and the integration of deep learning into embedded systems.
