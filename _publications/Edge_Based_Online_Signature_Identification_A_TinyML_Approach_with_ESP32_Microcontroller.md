This paper presents an edge-based online signature identification system using Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) and an ESP32 microcontroller. The proposed system utilizes the SVC2004-task1 dataset and applies Gaussian filtering, position normalization, size normalization, and length normalization as preprocessing techniques. A deep learning model with three fully connected layers is trained using Edge Impulse framework, and then deployed on the ESP32 board after quantizing the model into 8-bit. The system achieves a high identification accuracy of 94.94%, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of using TinyML and edge computing for online signature identification, which has potential applications in security and identification systems.
