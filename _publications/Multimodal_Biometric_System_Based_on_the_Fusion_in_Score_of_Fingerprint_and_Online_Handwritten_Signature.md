Abstract Multimodal biometrics is the technique of using multiple modalities on a single system. This allows us to overcome the limitations of unimodal systems, such as the inability to acquire data from certain individuals or intentional fraud, while improving recognition performance. In this paper, a study of score normalization and its impact on the performance of the system is performed. The fusion of scores requires prior normalisation before applying a weighted sum fusion that separates impostor and genuine scores into a common interval with close ranges. The experiments were carried out on three biometric databases. The results show that the proposed strategy performs very encouragingly, especially in combination with Empirical Modal Decomposition (EMD). The proposed fusion system shows good performance. The best result is obtained by merging the globality online signature and fingerprint where an EER of 1.69 % is obtained by normalizing the scores according to the Min-Max method.
