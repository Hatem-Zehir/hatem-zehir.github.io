The emerging long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM) are the widely used type of recurrent neural networks (RNN). A novel ECG biometric method based on the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and instantaneous frequencies extracted by the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) is presented. Deep learning and bidirectional long short-term memory neural networks were used for classification. The performance of the system was evaluated using PTB Diagnostic ECG Database. A testing accuracy of 89.33% was achieved when the evaluation was done with the full database, and an accuracy of 97.42% is achieved when the evaluation was done with 5 subjects. The main goal of this paper is to confirm the effectiveness of using instantaneous frequencies as a feature for biometric identification.
